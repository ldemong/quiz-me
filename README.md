Quiz Me starts by reading a list of questions and answers from a question bank and then asks the user each question, 
in random order, checking if the userâ€™s answer is correct. The program will keep track of how many questions are 
answered correctly and display the results at the end of the quiz. Quiz Me can handle multiple choice, free response,
and true-false questions.
